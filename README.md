## CLARIFY Biomedical Relation Extraction

Pipeline:

- `tools/1_process_umls.py`
  - Input: `MRREL.RRF`, `MRCONSO.RRF`, `MRSTY.RRF`
  - Output: `umls.txt_to_cui.pkl`, `umls.cui_to_txts.pkl`, `umls.reltxt_to_groups.pkl`, `umls.cui_to_types.pkl`, `umls.text_to_type.pkl`
  - Description: extracts useful information from the UMLS 2019AB files. Here, `txt` is a surface form for an entity; `reltxt` is a relation type; `group` is a pair of CUIs.

- `tools/2_split_sentences.py`
  - Input: `medline_abs.txt`
  - Output: `medline_spacy_sents.txt` (which becomes `medline_unique_sents.txt`)
  - Description: extracts sentences out of `medline_abs.txt`, which contains one MEDLINE abstract on each line.

- `tools/3_link_entities.py`
  - Input: `medline_unique_sents.txt`, `umls.txt_to_cui.pkl`
  - Output: `umls.linked_sentences.jsonl`
  - Description: identifies UMLS entities in sentences from MEDLINE abstracts, tags them, and saves the tags into `umls.linked_sentences.jsonl`.

```json
{
  "sent": "The specificity of the carcinoembryonic antigen test for identifying future colorectal cancer patients was 0.99 with a sensitivity of 0.12.",
  "matches": {
    "carcinoembryonic antigen test": [23, 52], 
    "future": [69, 75], 
    "colorectal cancer": [76, 93], 
    "patients": [94, 102], 
    "0.99": [107, 111], 
    "sensitivity": [119, 130], 
    "0.12": [134, 138]
  }
}
```

- `tools/4_generate_splits.py`
  - Input: `umls.linked_sentences.jsonl`, `umls.cui_to_txts.pkl`, `umls.reltxt_to_groups.pkl`
  - Middle: `umls.reltxt_all_combos.pkl`, `umls.linked_sentences_to_groups.jsonl`
  - Output: `triples_all.tsv`, `complete_train/dev/test.txt`, `triples_train/dev/test.tsv`, `entities.txt`, `relations.txt`
  - Description: generates the train/validation/test splits. While doing so, it generates `umls.reltxt_all_combos.pkl`, which is a large set of `e1\te2` strings, where `e1` and `e2` are the surface forms of two entities that are linked together. It also generates `umls.linked_sentences_to_groups.jsonl`.

Each element in `umls.linked_sentences_to_groups.jsonl` looks like this, where `groups` contains positive and negative examples of related entity pairs, where negative examples are not related in the Knowledge Base.

```json
{
  "sent": "To investigate the medium term outcome of cardiac surgery, we evaluated patients over 75 years of age who were operated on within a 1.5-year period.",
  "matches": {
    "medium": [
      19,
      25
    ],
    "term": [
      26,
      30
    ],
    "outcome": [
      31,
      38
    ],
    "cardiac surgery": [
      42,
      57
    ],
    "evaluated": [
      62,
      71

    "patients": [

    ],
    "years": [
      89,
      94
    ],
    "age": [
      98,
      101
    ],
    "within": [
      123,
      129
    ],
    "1.5": [
      132,
      135
    ],
    "year": [
      136,
      140

    "period": [
      141,
      147

  },
  "groups": {
    "p": [

    ],
    "n": [
      "patients\t1.5",
      "patients\tyears"
    ]
  }
}
```

Then, `triples_all.tsv` looks like the following:

```tsv
adiponectin	genetic_biomarker_related_to	acrp30
dose	has_system	methadone dose
celiac angiography	substance_used_by	contrast
physical therapy education	focus_of	physical therapy
autosomal dominant	has_inheritance_type	obese
```

And finally, `complete_train/dev/test.txt` looks like the following:

```json

  "relation": "temporally_followed_by", 
  "sentences": [
    "Radiographically, the approximation of fracture fragments, ^plate fracture^ and $screw loosening$ on orthopantomograph and Reverse Towne's view were evaluated at intervals of 24\u00a0h, six weeks and three months postoperatively.",

- `tools/5_generate_name_to_type_splits.py`

  - Output: `complete_types_train/dev/test.txt`, `triples_train/dev/test.tsv`, `triples_types_train/dev/test.tsv`
  - Description: generates the splits but including the entity types rather than just the entities.

More specifically, each line in `complete_types_train/dev/test.txt` looks like this:
